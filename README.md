"Game Tonight?" is a website created to find a football game to play in or find players to play in a game of your own. Organisers of local games are constantly looking for players to fill in for absentees or some people dont't know enough people to get a game organised themselves. This site aims to provide an oppurtunity for all people to access a game of football. 

A user will be able to make a post advertising a football game and other users will be able to comment on the post to confirm their availability.


## User Experience (UX)

### Strategy

#### Project Goals

* The site is designed very simply with a very basic colour scheme and layout so as to not take away the attention of the user and keep it on the important part of the site, the posts.

* The site must be responsive so as to be able to use it on multiple devices.

* The navigation and structure of the site must be easy to understand and easily navigated.

* Users of the site must be able to create an account so that they can comment and post.

* Site users should be able to search for a post so as to find one local to them.
